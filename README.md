# DogAlexa üê∂üîä


### Team Members  
- Team Lead: Deborah thomas ‚Äì [LBSITW trivandrum]  


### Project Description  
An AI-powered translator that interprets dog barks into hilarious human language. Because obviously, your dog has something deep to say.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Humans don't understand what their pets are barking about. Are they hungry? Are they tired of our Spotify playlists? The world may never know... until now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
DogAlexa listens to your dog, runs it through cutting-edge AI (and some guesswork), and translates it into meme-worthy phrases. You‚Äôll finally know your pet's political opinions and snack preferences.
